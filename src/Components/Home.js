          Hello and welcome to Jace's Emporium. Here, we value cunning, guile,
          ingenuity, and underhandedness. Fighting for the multiverse? Embarking
          on an epic quest to defeat a time-travelling plane-jumping
          godhood-ascending dragon? Trying to get the girl of your dreams so you
          can forget she ever existed (again)? No matter what you're looking
          for, we have it!
